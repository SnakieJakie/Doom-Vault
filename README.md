# Doom Vault

# About
This repository is designed to archive the DOS files for all of the Doom engine games. 

All of these should be the lastest version. 
- Ultimate Doom is V1.9
- Doom 2 is V1.9
- Final Doom is V1.9
- Heretic is V1.3
- Hexen (And DKOTDC) is V1.1
- Strife is V1.3

This does NOT contain the actual WAD files, you will need to get those yourself. After you extract the files, move your IWAD into the same folder and use something like [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com) to run them.

I mainly made this so that I can easily dowmload these if something happens. These are hard to find. >:(

# Download links
Since GitHub doesn't allow you to download entire directories, I'll just provide donwloads for all of them here.

# Other stuff
If you don't want to buy any of these games and want an demo, [there's an entire repository of the Shareware versions of these games.](https://github.com/Doom-Utils/shareware-collection)  The WAD files in those should run on any source port.

If you hate how the player move with the mouse, try using [Novert.](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/utils/misc/novert)

There's an version of Doom 2's EXE that raises the original limitations, called [Doom 2 Plus.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/prboom-plus/files/doom2-plus/1.92.6/doom2-plus-1.92.6.zip/download) This allows you to play most limit-removing WADS, like No Rest For The Living.
